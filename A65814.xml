            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43236:4"/>of the Law.</hi> Gal. 5.14. For <hi>all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou ≈øhalt love,</hi> &amp;c. That one little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øyllable Love, is a perfect abbreviation of the whole <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Pandects</hi> of the Divine Law. The fir≈øt and the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is this,

               <hi>Thou ≈øhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ≈øoul, with all thy mind, and with all thy might.</hi> And the Second is like unto it, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt love thy neighbour as thy ≈øelf: On the≈øe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that truly loves God, will not break any of his Commandments willfully; and he that doth not love him, cannot keep any of them.
<note place="margin">1 Jo 5.3.</note> 'Tis this love that keeps us from tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øing the Law, and ≈øo prevents ≈øin, and (as I ≈øhall ≈øhew hereafter) the ≈øame is u≈øefull to cover ≈øin, and to procure the pardon thereof. It keeps us from inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or offending our neighbour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to forgive his offences again≈øt us.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>the bond of perfection,</hi> both of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Grace, of Humanity and Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: A loving Di≈øpo≈øition is that which

Whereas the want of it, and e≈øpecially the contraries to it; an envious, malicious, peevi≈øh, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, rigid, cruel, covetous, and penuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind, is Ill Nature, Di≈øingenuous and Hatefull.</p>
            <p>Therefore the extream oppo≈øite to Love, beareth the name of Wickedne≈øs in an Emphatical Sen≈øe, in the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, as al≈øo in our own, and other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that have any Derivation from them.

            <p>But Charity <hi>is Goodne≈øs it ≈øelf,</hi> in the Common Sen≈øe of that Word, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it there is no ≈øuch thing as Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs truly ≈øo called.

               </p>
               <p>The De≈øign of my pre≈øent Di≈øcour≈øe is chiefly upon this particular Argument or Motive; which being well under≈øtood, and firmly believed, may be enough to ≈øave me the labour of adding many more found in other Texts, ≈øome of which have been briefly touched in the foregoing Chapter, and all, or mo≈øt of them amply ≈øet forth by others,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>I≈ø Barrow.</hi>
                  </note> e≈øpecially by a late worthy Per≈øon in his excellent Sermon upon the Subject of Charity. Whereas that particular Argument which is alledged in this Text (though it may have been mentioned by others) hath not, to my knowledge, been ≈øo di≈øtinctly and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43236:10"/>largely di≈øcu≈ø≈øed, as the Weight and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it ≈øeems to de≈øerve. There being no argument or motive to the practice of this Vertue, more like to prevail with per≈øons, ≈øen≈øible of the multitude and danger of their ≈øins, than this, if it may be admitted in the Sen≈øe hereafter declared. For this is mo≈øt notoriou≈øly known to have been the greate≈øt, and mo≈øt effectual Motive to that one common and eminent branch of this great Vertue, that hath in vulgar Speech monopolized the name of Charity, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Alms and Beneficence. This one ≈øimple Motive ≈øpecified in this Text, hath (I believe) prevailed more to this effect in all parts of Chri≈øtendom, with all ≈øorts of Per≈øons, in their life time, and at their death, than all the re≈øt. And this e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with ≈øuch People, as being much ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible of their ≈øins, have de≈øired to verifie the truth of their Repentance, by bringing forth fruits worthy of it. Among≈øt which there is none to be compared to the works of Charity.</p>
               <p>Though indeed there be many other Fruits worthy of repentance, in a ju≈øt ≈øen≈øe, but not equal to this. Such are all acts and works of extraordinary Devotion, all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices

Though I might pre≈øume them to be ≈øo well known to any Reader, that will be capable of under≈øtanding the future Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, (de≈øigned to be as plain as I am able to make it) as makes it unnece≈ø≈øary to give any large De≈øcription thereof, yet do I not judge it altogether needle≈øs to give any Account at all of it.</p>
               <p>Briefly then, Charity, or Love relating to our Neighbour (as by the expre≈øs words of the Text it doth) is not to be confined to that one eminent Branch thereof, which con≈øi≈øts only in Alms, or works of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, becau≈øe the≈øe are things, which po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly may be done without any true Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, 1 Cor. 13.8. <hi>Though I give all my goods to feed the Poor, and have not Charity</hi> (which Suppo≈øition were ab≈øurd, if it were ≈øimply impo≈ø≈øible) <hi>it profiteth me nothing.</hi> Vain-glory, carnal and worldly Ends and Intere≈øt, may utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy the notion and vertue of Charity in ≈øuch Works. And 'tis po≈ø≈øible for a man to exerci≈øe ≈øome acts of pretended Charity, to ≈øuch ends as are utterly repugnant to the Nature of it, as when they are done of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43236:13"/>purpo≈øe to corrupt the Minds and Manners of them, upon whom they are be≈øtowed, to entice them to Iniquity, and to ≈øerve the ends of the Donor, to the prejudice of the Receiver.</p>
               <p>And where none of the≈øe things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned, a man may yet be otherwi≈øe as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitute of true Charity, as the Devil is, and as much tainted with tho≈øe <hi>Vicio≈øities,</hi> that are mo≈øt contrary to it; Malice, Envy, Pride, Cruelty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet ≈øeem to be Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Alms. On the contrary, a true and acceptable Charity may exi≈øt without them: I mean without the outward Works, and that only in ca≈øe of Inability to afford them, or want of Objects to receive them; for otherwi≈øe the Di≈øpo≈øition and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind to afford them according to Ability, and opportunity, is in ≈øeparable from any true and real Charity.</p>
               <p>This po≈ø≈øible Mi≈øtake, grounded upon a vulgar u≈øe of the Word, being prevented, I ≈øay, That Charity in the due extent of its Notion comprehends all the Good, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the Evil that our Neighbour is capable of receiving from us; or that we are capable of intending or extending to him. Charity ≈øignifies all the benefit that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonably
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43236:13"/>de≈øirable from one Man to another. All that can profit or rea≈øonably plea≈øe him, all that can any way better his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pre≈øent or future: The Acts of it are as various and numerous, as are the needs, or capacities of advantage and benefit by our Neighbour in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind. To conclude,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.10.</note> Charity imports an aver≈øion or declining of all manner of Evil to him in Thought, Word or Deed, all <hi>Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection</hi> to him, all <hi>Mi≈øpeaking</hi> of him, or to him, and all <hi>Mi≈ødoing.</hi> And not only all ≈øorts of Injuries, but all Unkindne≈ø≈øes, inward of will and affections, and outward of words, actions and ge≈øtures.</p>
               <p>He that de≈øires any more Particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this Vertue, may find it ≈øet forth in that known Chapter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> fir≈øt Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 13. And all that mo≈øt exactly abridged by that General Precept of our Saviour, of <hi>doing to others as we would be done to:</hi> only the word <hi>do,</hi> is therein to be extended as well to thoughts, and words, as to any ≈øort of outward actions: agreeable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon u≈øe of the ≈øame word in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, applied to thoughts and words, as well as deeds, whil≈øt we ≈øay, we do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43236:14"/>think, and we do Love, and we do ≈øpeak. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Whatever ye</hi> do <hi>in word, or deed do all in the name of the Lord Je≈øus,</hi> &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoughts and words are the mo≈øt Peculiar of Humane Acts. This Precept, I ≈øay, in the due extent of it, rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, by the Rules and Mea≈øures of a rea≈øonable will (which only can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood in the ≈øentence) is the mo≈øt Perfect Rule of Humane Equity, that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in words, comprehending al≈øo the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Perfection of Chri≈øtian Charity.</p>
               <p>Having now premi≈øed this brief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription of the Vertue of Charity, I come to the Particular Argument, or Motive, whereby it is urged by the Apo≈øtle in this Text. <hi>Charity ≈øhall cover a multitude of ≈øins.</hi> And here I am to ≈øpeak by way of Explication and Confirmation.</p>
               <p>By way of Explication, I ≈øhall make the≈øe three Inquiries,</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Who≈øe ≈øins they are which the Apo≈øtle means will be covered by Charity?</p>
               <p>Secondly, What's meant by the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ≈øins?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What ≈øort of ≈øins will be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Charity, and under what Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations?</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43236:14"/>
               <p>After I ≈øhall have given a Competent Explication of the Propo≈øition, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution of the≈øe Que≈øtions, I ≈øhall Confirm the General Doctrine from other Texts of Scripture, with ≈øome Allegations of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and then an≈øwer ≈øome Objections, like to be made again≈øt that Interpretation of the Text, which I ≈øhall pitch upon, and again≈øt the General Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a≈ø≈øerted.</p>

               <p n="1">I. This Sen≈øe, if it may be allowed in the matter of it, to expre≈øs a certain truth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43236:15"/>(as I doubt not to prove, pa≈øt all doubt, from other Texts) affords a Motive to the inforcement of the Apo≈øtles Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øo much more ≈øtrong and effectual than the other Sen≈øe, as the covering of a multitude of a mans own fins, is a greater Benefit to him, than the covering of any multitude of other mens ≈øins can be; and therefore the hopes of it, mu≈øt needs be mo≈øt prevalent with any man that hath not more Charity for his Neighbour, than he hath for him≈øelf. Whereas therefore the ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle in the≈øe words (as appears by that Cau≈øal Particle, <hi>For</hi>) is only to pre≈øs the foregoing Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ≈øeems not rea≈øonable to abate the ≈øtrength of his Argument, by excluding the mo≈øt per≈øwa≈øive Sen≈øe of his words, and confining it (without nece≈ø≈øity) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of le≈øs concern, and weaker ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, as mo≈øt clearly that is which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects only the ≈øins of other men.</p>
               <p>But that which mo≈øt ≈øtrongly confirms this to be the ≈øpecial Sen≈øe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles words, is to be collected from the Connexion of this Ver≈øe with the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein he forewarneth the Jewi≈øh Chri≈øtians, to whom the Epi≈øtle is directed,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43236:16"/>of a Fatal End that was near at hand: and thereupon advi≈øeth them, what they ≈øhould do to ≈øecure them≈øelves in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>The end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore ≈øober, and watch unto prayer.

I ≈øay whether it be the <hi>end</hi> of the World, or (which is more probable to be the Apo≈øtles meaning) the Fatal De≈øtruction of the obdurate Jews, their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43236:16"/>Politie Royal City, and Temple, foretold by Chri≈øt him≈øelf, and often ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by his Apo≈øtles, which was then very near indeed: This being the ground, and occa≈øion of the Apo≈øtles Exhortation to fervent Charity, leads us to the mo≈øt rea≈øonable Interpretation of the≈øe latter words of the ver≈øe: For <hi>Charity will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a multitude of ≈øins;</hi> 
                  <q rend="margQuotes">That is, when the end of all things, which is near at hand, ≈øhall come, fervent Charity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, and joyned with Repentance, ≈øignified by the foregoing expre≈ø≈øions of Sobriety, Watching and Praying, is the likelie≈øt means to propitiate the wrath of God, de≈øerved by a multitude of ≈øins, and to ≈øave you from the formidable judgement of God, which is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</q> I appeal to any indifferent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, whether this coherence of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles words doth not determine his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relate to the ≈øins of the Charitable Per≈øon, much rather than the ≈øins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43236:17"/>(as by the Context in this place it is) to the end of all things: That is, how Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ≈øhould cover a multitude of ≈øins in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Per≈øons, when the end of all things is come, is hard to conceive; but ea≈øie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to under≈øtand, how it may then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a multitude of ≈øins in the Charitable Per≈øon, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewed in its due place.</p>
               <p>The mo≈øt rational Objection again≈øt this Interpretation and Argument for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the other Sen≈øe, is rai≈øed from a parallel Text, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Hatred ≈øtirreth up ≈øtrife; but Love covereth all ≈øins.</hi> And if the Apo≈øtles words, ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be borrowed from that Sentence, mu≈øt receive the ≈øame Interpretation with that, it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily be under≈øtood of other mens ≈øins; by the two contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Love and Hatred, ≈øet forth in that Text, the one ≈øtirring up ≈øtrife, the other preventing it, by covering the faults of other men, by not taking notice of them, or looking favourably upon them, in order to a peaceable and friendly living with them</p>
               <p>But to this Objection it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered. 1. That it is not evident that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did intend any quotation of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,

But to this Objection, together with ≈øome others, a fuller an≈øwer ≈øhall be made afterward.</p>
               <p>¬ß. 2. The probability of this Sen≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus declared from the Context, the Truth of it remains to be further confirmed from many other Texts of Scripture: but I ≈øu≈øpend the addition of them, till I have an≈øwered the ≈øecond Que≈øtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing the ≈øins ≈øpoken of in this Sentence to be the ≈øins of the Charitable per≈øon, the que≈øtion is, what's meant by the word Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, or in what Sen≈øe they may be ≈øaid to be covered by Charity?

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43236:18"/>towards the obtaining of a pardon of ≈øins in the charitable Procurer. For if that Sen≈øe, which I have given of the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> be admitted to import a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, (as I doubt not to evince from many other Texts afterward) the like Sen≈øe of this of St. <hi>James</hi> (whether by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or not) will nece≈ø≈øarily follow to contain the ≈øame Truth. The Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a ≈øinner, or the ≈øincere and earne≈øt Endeavour thereof, being (as before was ≈øaid) an eminent act of Spiritual Charity. But for the probability of that Sen≈øe of St. <hi>James</hi> his words, I mu≈øt at this time refer the Reader to the Notes of the forenamed Doctor upon the Text, becau≈øe it would be too great an Excur≈øion to undertake the Confirming of it in this place. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be the true Sen≈øe of St. <hi>James</hi> or not, no doubt can be made, but that the particular Phra≈øe of Covering of ≈øins doth very fitly expre≈øs the Pardon of them, when it is attributed to God, as in the Texts ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before: And when it is attributed to Men, or to any act or vertue in them, as it is in this Text, it may very fitly ≈øignifie the obtaining or procuring of ≈øuch a favour (as the Pardon of ≈øin) from God.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:43236:19"/>
               <p>The Metaphor may be borrowed from the Covering of Nakedne≈øs, to which ≈øin is often compared, or to the Covering of a Sore with a Plai≈øter, or the Covering of a Debt charged in a Book, by way of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or Blotting out, which is another Synonymous phra≈øe, ≈øignifying the Pardon of ≈øin. Both Phra≈øes ≈øignifying the Pardon thing with the Hiding of ≈øin from the face or the eyes of God, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51.9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ≈øins, and blot out mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Not that God ≈øhould not ≈øee them, but that he ≈øhould not impute them, as the ≈øame Words are interpreted by the P≈øalmi≈øt, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 32.1, 2 and by the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they who≈øe iniquities are forgiven, and who≈øe ≈øins are covered, Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ≈øin.</hi> As Men are ≈øaid to hide their own ≈øins, when they will not acknowledge them, nor admit them≈øelves chargeable with the imputation of them: So doth God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øin, by his not imputing, or charging the guilt of it upon a man. And this is one way among≈øt others (as ≈øhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after declared) whereby Charity, or the Charitable Per≈øon doth cover a multitude of ≈øins in his Neighbour, according to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43236:19"/>other Sen≈øe of the Text, that is, doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give and excu≈øe them, and ≈øo cover them from his own eyes, either by not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, or not imputing them to the Offender.</p>
               <p>But to di≈øcharge this Que≈øtion; If by the multitude of ≈øins ≈øpoken of in this Text, be under≈øtood the ≈øins of the Charitable Per≈øon, it is ≈øufficiently evident by the U≈øe of the Phra≈øe, what the Covering of them meaneth, <hi>viz.</hi> nothing le≈øs than the Pardon or Remi≈ø≈øion of the ≈øaid ≈øins.</p>
               <p>¬ß. 3. But then for a clear under≈øtanding of this Effect, it will be nece≈ø≈øary to enquire what may be under≈øtood by the Pardon of ≈øin? A Phra≈øe not ≈øo plain, but that it hath afforded matter of more Controver≈øie, than I am willing to take notice of in this Place: intending to di≈øcharge my ≈øelf and my Reader of all the puzzle of Di≈øtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the nature and ≈øignification of this ea≈øie Word, and take up with that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meaning, which is mo≈øt agreeable to common Sen≈øe and Vulgar apprehen≈øion: Namely, that by the Pardon or Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin is meant a Di≈øcharge of the ≈øin from the puni≈øhment, or obligation to puni≈øhment; For that the Remi≈ø≈øion of <hi>the Fault,</hi> without
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43236:20"/>the Remi≈ø≈øion of <hi>the Guilt,</hi> which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and Others of his Order conte≈øt for, is to me a Riddle, a ≈øen≈øele≈øs Notion, and the Effect of it a real Nullity. Not but that there may be a true and effectual Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the fault, without an ab≈øolute and total Remi≈ø≈øion of all puni≈øhment, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewn hereafter. But then the Remi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fault, is no more then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of the puni≈øhment, and no more of the Fault is remitted, then is of the Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Fault is no otherwi≈øe remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than the Puni≈øhment is. But to imagin a Fault to be entirely or perfectly remitted, without any Remi≈ø≈øion of the Puni≈øhment, is either a perfect Contradiction, or a very uncomfortable ≈øort of Pardon, and ≈øuch as I think, the Devils would not much envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of Mankind to obtain.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall therefore take it for granted, that all Pardon of ≈øin doth import ≈øome Remi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at lea≈øt of the puni≈øhment, I ≈øay ≈øome Remi≈ø≈øion, becau≈øe, as there is a great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in the nature, kinds, degrees, extent and duration of the Puni≈øhment; ≈øo may there be an an≈øwerable Variation and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Pardon of ≈øins, (≈øignified by the phra≈øe of Covering of them in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43236:20"/>Text) as to the matter, mea≈øures, degrees, and duration thereof. And ≈øo Sin may be truly ≈øaid to be covered or pardoned, not only when all the Puni≈øhment is remitted or removed, but al≈øo when any ≈øort, part or degree thereof is taken off or abated; as al≈øo when the remainder of Puni≈øhment is relieved, or balanced by ≈øome advantages to the Patient. But of this more is to be ≈øaid in the following Di≈øcour≈øe, concerning the Puni≈øhment of ≈øin in general.</p>
               <p>¬ß. 4 The puni≈øhment of Sin, importing all evil con≈øequences thereof, is as various as the ≈øin, both in its kind and degrees. And as in the general Notion, all ≈øin doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt in ≈øome repugnancy or oppo≈øition to the Will of God:
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.4.</note> So all Puni≈øhment con≈øi≈øts in ≈øomething that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the rea≈øonable will and wellfare of the Sinner. And this is mo≈øt ju≈øt, that he that will not obey the Will of God, ≈øhould be cro≈øs'd in his own Will; if Men be ≈øo willfull, as not to ≈øubmit to the Will of God, they ≈øhall never have their own will, do what they can. For the natural and nece≈ø≈øary Object of mans Will is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing le≈øs then a true and real Happine≈øs, con≈øi≈øting in a perfect freedom from Evil,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43236:21"/>and in the injoyment of all the Good that he is capable of. But the only Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this Happine≈øs is Holine≈øs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts in the Conformity of our wills to the Will of God. He therefore that is not, at lea≈øt in ≈øome mea≈øure Holy, can never be in any mea≈øure Happy. But to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly or perfectly Happy, no man is, or can be capable, till he be perfectly Holy; that is, till there be a perfect Conformity of his will to the Will of God. There is no way to obtain a full and perfect Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our own wills, but by ≈øubmitting them to the Will of God. So ≈øhall we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly at la≈øt have our own will, and fill of Happine≈øs: though for the pre≈øent we do mi≈øs of our own carnal and fooli≈øh will, and mu≈øt ≈øtay for the accompli≈øhment of our mo≈øt rea≈øonable De≈øires, till we be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it. The true, ≈øub≈øtantial, final, and perfect Object of our will, (≈øuppo≈øing that it be conformable and obedient to the Will of God) we cannot fail of at la≈øt; but mu≈øt not look for it, till we come where it is to be had, that is, in Heaven, (for Earth is not capable of it) where all our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, un≈øatisfying Volitions, Wi≈øhes and De≈øires will be utterly extinct, and our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43236:21"/>whole will and affections will be ≈øatisfied with the utmo≈øt Felicity they are capable of: So that we ≈øhall have nothing further to wi≈øh, but the unchangeable Continuance of that State; And that al≈øo we ≈øhall be ≈øo well a≈ø≈øured of, as that the Will, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire in that re≈øpect ≈øhall be abundantly ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Whence one hath fitly called Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs <hi>Pax De≈øiderii, a rest or peace to all De≈øire.</hi> When De≈øire ≈øhall give place to Joy, and ≈øtir no more, whereas here it is re≈øtle≈øs, and never can cea≈øe, till it be fully ≈øatisfied.</p>
               <p>But to return from this digre≈ø≈øion, to the Di≈øcour≈øe that occa≈øion'd it. I ≈øaid before, that all ≈øin is a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, or oppo≈øition to the will of God, and all puni≈øhment con≈øi≈øts in ≈øomething oppo≈øite to the rea≈øonable Object of our own wills. But here it is to be noted, that as men may be mi≈øtaken in the Object of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, thinking that to be agreeable, which is contrary thereunto: So may they be deceived in the right Object of their own wills, which in the true Notion is ≈øomething that is good for them, and tending to their ≈øafety, welfare, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs. But this apprehen≈øion is very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43236:22"/>to errour, and nothing more common then for men by ≈øuch errour, <hi>to call evil good, and good evil, to put darkne≈øs for light, and light for darkne≈øs, to put bitter for ≈øweet, and ≈øweet for bitter,</hi> as in things that relate to the Will of God, ≈øo in things relating to the right Objects of their own will, and happine≈øs. But this errour cannot change the nature of the things in either ca≈øe. The bare thinking of a thing to be good, or evil, doth not make it ≈øo, either in a Moral, or in a Phy≈øical ≈øen≈øe: Men may be puni≈øhed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their own blind and infatuate wills: and they may be ble≈ø≈øed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in the want of ≈øuch enjoyments, and in things contrary thereunto. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted good, though it gratifies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived will, may be a real puni≈øhment; and a ≈øen≈øible evil ≈øuffered again≈øt a mans will, may be a ≈øignal Ble≈ø≈øing: To be puni≈øhed by Pro≈øperity, and ble≈ø≈øed by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øity, is no contradiction. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was hardned to his de≈øtruction, by the ce≈ø≈øation of the Plagues; and <hi>Mana≈ø≈øes</hi> was ≈øaved by his Captivity, and the Fetters of his Pri≈øon. And many a man may ≈øay, <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii≈ø≈øem, ni≈øi perii≈ø≈øem,</hi> I had peri≈øhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43236:22"/>if I had not been undone for a time.</p>
               <p>It is not nece≈ø≈øary to the puni≈øhment of ≈øin, that men ≈øhould be at the pre≈øent ≈øen≈øible of it. And though he mu≈øt needs be unhappy for the pre≈øent, that thinks him≈øelf ≈øo, becau≈øe that thought is enough to make him ≈øo, as being incon≈øi≈øtent with his pre≈øent happine≈øs: yet he is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily happy that accounts him≈øelf ≈øo: otherwi≈øe men might be happy when they are out of their wits: and made mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in recovering them. As the man in the Poet complained.</p>

               </q>
               <p>But to hold to the Analogy between the Will of God, and the will of Man, in the nature of ≈øin and puni≈øhment, I ≈øay further, that as the Will of God is tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øed by omi≈ø≈øion, or commi≈ø≈øion, by leaving undone ≈øomething which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, or doing ≈øomething which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids: ≈øo the puni≈øhments of ≈øin are either <hi>Privative,</hi> or <hi>Po≈øitive,</hi> con≈øi≈øting in the lo≈øs, or want of ≈øomething that is Good
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43236:23"/>and De≈øirable by a rea≈øonable Will, or in the ≈øen≈øe and ≈øuffering of ≈øomething which is Evil and grievous to the Will. And both the≈øe ≈øorts of Puni≈øhments, are ≈øuch as befall Men in this Life, or in that which is to come, and ≈øo are temporal, or Eternal: Some of them al≈øo are <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>nece≈ø≈øary,</hi> and ≈øome <hi>contingent</hi> and <hi>avoidable,</hi> as being ordered and appointed by the ju≈øt Will and Providence of God, without any natural or ab≈øolute Nece≈ø≈øity of their Event. I ≈øay, ≈øome ≈øorts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of ≈øin are <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as being the Natural Effects and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequents of the ≈øin, and ≈øo, nece≈ø≈øary and unavoidable, and that either ab≈øolutely, or without a Miracle. Ab≈øolutely una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable the Puni≈øhment mu≈øt needs be, when the Separation of the Penal Event imports contradiction to the ≈øinfull act, as is evident, not only in the ca≈øe of Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (which being nothing el≈øe but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving a man of his Life, cannot without Contradiction be ≈øeparated from the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Puni≈øhment) but al≈øo in all other ≈øins, whereby Men do deprive them≈øelves, at lea≈øt for the pre≈øent, of the enjoyment of Health, Honour, Friends, or any other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43236:23"/>good thing. And as every act of true Vertue doth in a ju≈øt ≈øen≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it ≈øelf by its real and moral Goodne≈øs;
<note place="margin">Virius e≈øt ≈øui ip≈øius merces.</note> ≈øo doth every ≈øinfull Act puni≈øh it ≈øelf by its turpitude or evil deformity, which in the School Language is called the <hi>Macula,</hi> or ≈øtain of ≈øin And this Puni≈øhment is in the nature of the thing in≈øeparable from the ≈øin. Other puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not ≈øo ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary, as to imply any Contradiction in the avoidance or eva≈øion of them, and yet are really unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable without a Miracle, as is obvious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conceive without any In≈øtances.</p>
               <p>Now in ≈øuch ca≈øes the covering of the ≈øin, as it ≈øignifies a total Remi≈ø≈øion, or perfect Exemption from all Puni≈øhment, is either ≈øimply unpo≈ø≈øible, as in the ca≈øe of ≈øuch ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of the Event, as implies a contradiction to the ≈øin in the avoidance, or el≈øe is not promi≈øed, or to be expected (though po≈ø≈øible by Miracle) upon any condition. I ≈øay ≈øuch a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ≈øin as imports a total Remi≈ø≈øion of Puni≈øhment, is either impo≈ø≈øible, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectable: Yet may the ≈øame ≈øin in ≈øome other ≈øence be many ways covered, <hi>viz.</hi> by abatement of the degrees of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43236:24"/>which is not wholly avoidable; or by deliverance from ≈øome other Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment, which might be added in this Life, and that which is to come: or by ≈øundry manner and mea≈øures of Support, Relief, and Comfort in the Suffering, or by other ways, whereby the Puni≈øhment may be converted to the Advantage of the Sufferer, e≈øpecially in his Spiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate; which Advantages are ≈øo far from being incon≈øi≈øtent with the nature of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment, that they are ordinarily de≈øigned, as the main end of it, both by God and Man, as in all ca≈øtigatory Puni≈øhments; whence God is ≈øaid to cha≈øten us for our Profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. And a Puni≈øhment cea≈øeth not to be ≈øo, by being converted to a Ble≈ø≈øing. Thus may the ≈øins of a Charitable Per≈øon be covered, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ab≈øolute Remi≈ø≈øion, or Exemption from Puni≈øhment, which may be in it ≈øelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary. And where it is not ≈øo, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent at the Will and Providence of God; it is more ea≈øie to conceive how the ≈øin may be covered by Su≈øpen≈øion, or Remi≈ø≈øion of Puni≈øhment, in whole, or in part.</p>

               <p>On the other ≈øide, If by <hi>the end of all things</hi> mu≈øt be under≈øtood that General End which is to come at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the more ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43236:25"/>of the words, it is evident, that this benefit of Charity will extend to another Life. But becau≈øe the Puni≈øhment of ≈øin (as hath been ≈øaid before) is both in this Life, and that which is to come, without Determining the true Sen≈øe of the foregoing Ver≈øe, I doubt not to conclude, that the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, expre≈ø≈øed by the covering thereof, declared by the Apo≈øtle, is not to be limited to this or the other Life, but may be under≈øtood of both, and will be verified either in both, or at lea≈øt in one of the≈øe two Lives; that is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever this Vertue of Charity is found, it will be available by the Mercy of God at lea≈øt to ≈øome kind of Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Puni≈øhment thereof, either in this Life, and that which is to come too, or el≈øe in one of them more or le≈øs, according to the ≈øincerity and degree of the Charity.</p>
               <p>If the Charity be the Fruit of an unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Faith accompanied with Repentance, (as it mu≈øt needs be, if it be ≈øincere) it will undoubtedly be available to the Remi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of ≈øin in the other World, if not al≈øo to the Remi≈ø≈øion of Puni≈øhment in this World; which is very hopefull, though not ≈øo certain in all Re≈øpects, as is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43236:26"/>of future Puni≈øhment in the Life to come: Becau≈øe there are ≈øome ≈øorts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments of ≈øin in this Life, which (as was ≈øhewed before) are in them≈øelves nece≈ø≈øary, and in≈øeparable Con≈øequents of the ≈øin, and ≈øo unavoidable in their Nature, as Shame and Di≈øhonour in ≈øins known to the World, privation of Benefits con≈øequent to other ≈øins, ≈øorrow and remor≈øe of Con≈øcience, common to all ≈øins, whereof a ≈øinner is convinced: Be≈øides ≈øome other ≈øorts of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments in this Life, not ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary in their kind, may be con≈øequent to the ≈øin, by the Ju≈øtice and Wi≈ødom, and al≈øo by the Goodne≈øs of God: which therefore he may refu≈øe to remit in this Life, where he intends a full Remi≈ø≈øion in the Life to come. This is plain in the Ca≈øe of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. Many ≈øevere Puni≈øhments are threatned by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, to be executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>David</hi> for his ≈øcandalous ≈øins of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murder, which were never remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but punctually executed upon him, notwith≈øtanding, that upon his Repentance, te≈øtified by his humble Confe≈ø≈øion, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet a≈ø≈øures him, that <hi>God had put away his ≈øin,</hi> and <hi>that he ≈øhould not die.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>And David ≈øaid unto Nathan, I have

               </p>
               <p>His repentance expre≈ø≈øed by extraordinary te≈øtimonies of his Sorrow and Humiliation, ≈øet forth in that <hi>P≈øalm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P≈øal. 51.</note> which was penn'd and publi≈øhed by him≈øelf for that end, was not ≈øufficient to deliver him from all Puni≈øhment of his ≈øin, although it was accepted for his Deliverance, not only from the puni≈øhment of eternal Death, but al≈øo of ≈øuch a temporal Death, as he was ju≈øtly lyable to by the Law; which though it could not be executed upon him by any Human Authority, by rea≈øon of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, yet might have been executed by the Hand of God, who had threatned by Him≈øelf to revenge and puni≈øh ≈øuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumptuous ≈øins, as the Magi≈øtrate could not, or ≈øhould neglect to puni≈øh, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.14. But did not thereby deprive him≈øelf of liberty to forbear ≈øuch Execution of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment according to his Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs.</p>
               <p>By this Example, and ≈øeveral others that might be alledged (if it were needfull in this place) it appears, that a Part of the puni≈øhment of ≈øin may be remitted, where
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43236:27"/>the whole is not, which I take to be the common Ca≈øe of Mankind, fallen under the guilt and puni≈øhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ≈øin; for it is experimentally evident,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> that the whole Puni≈øhment is not remitted to any Man, becau≈øe all are known to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many Penalties threatned in this Life, be≈øides that common one of Temporal Death; whil≈øt that of Eternal Death is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to many, and promi≈øed to all that repent.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Point in hand, I ≈øay, ≈øincere Charity proceeding from a true Faith, and accompanied with an unfeigned Repentance, will certainly deliver the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Per≈øon from the Everla≈øting puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another Life, and may al≈øo be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable either to ≈øave a man from all Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhments in this Life, or to abate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of them.</p>
               <p>But if the Charity be not fincere, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with any ≈øuch Repentance, as will render the ≈øinner capable of Salvation in the other Life, yet it may be, and doubtle≈øs will be available for the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the per≈øon from Puni≈øhments in this Life, either in whole or in part.

               <p>My rea≈øon for this Opinion is grounded upon that Fundamental Principle of all Religion; That all men ≈øhall fare in the life to come,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note> according to the things done by them in this Life, whether they be good, or whether they be bad. Which Rule is under≈øtood not only of the re≈øpective ≈øtates of Salvation, and Damnation, but al≈øo of the degrees of Reward and Puni≈øhment in that ≈øtate. As for the ≈øtate of Puni≈øhment, no que≈øtion hath been, or can be made, concerning the difference of its degrees, expre≈øsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Scripture, ≈øignifying that it ≈øhall

               <p>And that among all ≈øorts of Good Works, tho≈øe of Charity to our Brethren will then have a ≈øpecial Confideration, is ≈øufficiently intimated by the words of our Saviour in his own De≈øcription of the la≈øt Judgement. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31. to the end of the Chapter, <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat, I was thir≈øty, and ye gave me drink, I was a ≈øtranger, and ye took me in, naked, and ye clothed me,</hi> &amp;c, A Text which I ≈øhall have occa≈øion to ≈øpeak more largely of afterward, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Doctrine. And as by this Declaration of our Saviour him≈øelf, who is to be Judge at that day, it is evident, that Works of Charity, proceeding from an unfeigned Faith, will then be ≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly con≈øidered, as a qualification for the General Reward; ≈øo that the Degrees and Mea≈øures of that Reward, will be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to the Mea≈øures of Charity, ≈øeems no le≈øs evident by the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle, ≈øpeaking al≈øo of the ≈øame ≈øort of works, 2.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43236:34"/>namely; That if the Doctrine collected from this Interpretation, be proved to be True; and ≈øufficiently Confirmable from other Scriptures, this Interpretation hath a fair advantage of Preference before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the before noted Scope of the Context, and the far greater Validity of the Argument thus under≈øtood, to enforce the Exhortation that precedes it. And therefore towards the better ≈øatisfaction of ≈øome prejudiced Readers (who≈øe Objections ≈øhall be con≈øidered in due place) it will be nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øhew the undeniable Truth of this Doctrine, from other Texts of both Te≈øtaments, which for their Number are far more than are ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary for the Confirmation of any Doctrine. Nor ≈øhould I think it rea≈øonable to quote ≈øo many of them, as I ≈øhall do, were it not, that by the ≈øame Labour, I hope, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate the Truth of this Doctrine, but al≈øo to promote the Practice of the Apo≈øtles Exhortation upon this ≈øingular Motive, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to many others, which fall not within the compa≈øs of this Text. I ≈øay, that by the many Texts (by which I hope to make it appear, that Charity to our Neighbours for Gods ≈øake, and with re≈øpect to his Will
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43236:35"/>and good Plea≈øure, is ≈øo much conducible to the Pardon of our ≈øins,) the Practice of this Vertue, will al≈øo appear more advi≈øable to them, that are lea≈øt di≈øpo≈øed to it, than perhaps hath been formerly con≈øidered or under≈øtood by them.

               <p>The fir≈øt Argument which I ≈øhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for the Truth of this Doctrine, ≈øhall be taken from tho≈øe Texts, which ≈øpeak of ≈øuch an Act of Charity, as is more commonly under≈øtood in this Text; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That whereby we Cover the ≈øins of others, by Forgiving them their Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes again≈øt our ≈øelves.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43236:36"/>≈øeem not to con≈øider the Context, before and after the≈øe Words, which apparently ≈øpeaks of ≈øuch Mercy and Charity, as is to be exerci≈øed by Men toward their Brethren, which being al≈øo the undoubted Meaning of the Word in this Ver≈øe; the plain ≈øen≈øe of the whole Ver≈øe can be no other than this, that the Unmercifull man ≈øhall find no Mercy in the day of Judgment. On the contrary, that Mercy, or the Mercifull man, ≈øhall have his Judgment ≈øo tempered with Mercy, as to give him cau≈øe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in that Day for Deliverance or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the Judgment of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Fear of it. This Goodne≈øs or Mercy found in Men, (if it be true and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere) being the Effect of Gods Grace, doth di≈øpo≈øe and fit Men for Divine Mercy. Mercy in the Per≈øon to be judged qualifies him for the Mercy of the Judge. Not that any ≈øuch Charity or Mercy can be found in a Sinner, as is ≈øufficient in it ≈øelf to ju≈øtifie him, or expiate his ≈øin in ≈øtrictne≈øs of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice or Merit, but that by the Goodne≈øs and Mercy of God, for Chri≈øts Sake, it ≈øhall obtain this Effect in the la≈øt Judgment.</p>
               <p>And as in this fir≈øt Branch of the Text, the word Mercy twice u≈øed doth plainly ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43236:37"/>the Mercy of God, as well as the mercy of Man; <hi>He ≈øhall have Judgment without Mercy, i. e.</hi> from God, <hi>that hath ≈øhewed no Mercy</hi> to men. So in the ≈øecond Branch, the ≈øame word Mercy, may have re≈øpect both to the Mercy of God (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Good Divines have interpreted it) and to the Mercy of men. It is Mercy in God rejoycing over Judgment or Ju≈øtice, that gives men Cau≈øe of Rejoycing; and Mercy in men, that by Divine Acceptance quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them for that Mercy of God.</p>

               <p>In each part of this De≈øcription of the di≈øtributive Ju≈øtice, or Judgement of God in the latter day, a common <hi>Synechdoche</hi> of the Part for the Whole, mu≈øt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood,

               <p>I ≈øhall mention but one Text more from the Mouth of our Saviour, and that, is <hi>Luke</hi> 11.41. <hi>But rather give Alms of ≈øuch things as you have, and behold all things are clean unto you.</hi> The ≈øcope of which words mo≈øt agreeable to the Context appears to be this, That whereas the Phari≈øees, by a ≈øuper≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Tradition did imagin, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for them to wa≈øh their Hands before they did eat, to purge them≈øelves from any Pollution, that might render them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and ≈øo unfit to partake of the Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of God in the u≈øe of their ordinary meat: our Saviour reprooving that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitious Conceit, in≈øtructs them to a better way of purifying both Them≈øelves and their Meat: and that was <hi>by giving of Alms of what they po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed.</hi> That being a ≈øpecial te≈øtimony and fruit of Repentance, which is nece≈ø≈øary and effectual to the Purgation of all Spiritual Pollution. A thing which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43236:45"/>by its Acceptance with God was fifted to procure his Parcon of all ≈øin, that might render them unworthy of partaking of any of his Benefits. The only thing that could pollute them and tho≈øe Creatures, which they were to receive, by Depriving them of the Ble≈ø≈øing of God in the u≈øe of them was ≈øin. And to think that that could be clean≈øed, or purged away by the outward Wa≈øhing of their Hands, was a gro≈øs piece of Super≈øtition: Although it wanted not ≈øome appearance of Foundation from the Ceremonial Precepts in <hi>Mo≈øes's</hi> Law; for ≈øeveral Wa≈øhings were enjoined to clean≈øe the <hi>Jews</hi> from a ≈øort of Legal and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Pollution: but never were defigned for any Purgation from any Moral uncleanne≈øs or ≈øin. But the giving of Alms, according to the Ability of the Giver (≈øignified by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>) doth indeed import ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a true and real Purification of the Heart, as it is an effect of Charity, which is the be≈øt Fruit of an unreigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereby the ≈øoul is clean≈øed from the guilt and pollution of ≈øin.</p>
               <p>For there are two Parts of Repentance: the Fir≈øt is <hi>to cea≈øe to do Evil,</hi> and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>to learn to do Well.</hi> As 'tis de≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43236:46"/>by the Prophet <hi>I≈øay,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 16, 17, 18. A Text which I am to urge after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as a pregnant Confirmation of the Doctrine a≈ø≈øerted in this Di≈øcour≈øe. <hi>John</hi> the Bapti≈øt preaching the Bapti≈øm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth this upon his Auditory, that they ≈øhould <hi>bring forth Bruits worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> So did St. <hi>Paul</hi> in all places where he preached, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26.20. exhorting them <hi>to repent, and turn to God, and do Works meet for Repentance;</hi> ≈øuch indeed are all manner of Good Works and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaining from Evil: And works of Mercy and Alms-giving being mo≈øt eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt Good Works, are by a common Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechdoche of the Part for the Whole, put for all Good Works. And the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs of Repentance is ≈øometime de≈øcribed by them, as ≈øhall be ≈øhewn from ≈øeveral Texts of the Old Te≈øtament, which remain to be quoted in their due place.</p>
               <p>But as to the Sen≈øe of that Speech of our Saviour, which I am yet ≈øpeaking of, it ≈øeemeth to agree with that of St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nto the Pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, is nothing pure, but even their

                  </gap> Meats, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures of God (as our Saviour doth in this Speech) declaring the U≈øe of them <hi>to the Pure, i. e.</hi> to all penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers (oppo≈øed to them that are defiled and unbelieving, <hi>who≈øe Mind and Con≈øcience is defiled</hi> with ≈øin unrepented of) are pure. The only Difference of the≈øe two Sayings ≈øeemeth to be this: That whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeaks of a general Purity, our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øeth the ≈øame thing Synechdochically, by a particular eminent In≈øtance of Good Works, ≈øuppo≈øed to proceed from a common principle of Sanctification &amp; Purity of Heart.</p>
               <p>To conclude my Animadver≈øion upon the Text, that which our Saviour means is, as if he had ≈øaid, to go about to clean≈øe the Body, without regard to the Soul, is vain and unprofitable. But on the contrary, the Soul being clean≈øed by Repentance, te≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ≈øuch an eminent Fruit of it, as is the giving of Alms (≈øuppo≈øed to be con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in their Mea≈øure, and proportionable to the Ability of the Giver) all things (not forbidden by God) are clean, and free to be u≈øed without fear of Pollution, and with confidence of his Ble≈ø≈øing.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:43236:47"/>
               <p>If this be not the Meaning of our Saviour in this ob≈øcure Text. I know not what it ≈øhould be. But if it be ≈øo, it plainly and fully confirms the Doctrine which I have in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that Charity is a ≈øpecial and effectual means for the Covering of ≈øin, which is all one with the Clean≈øing from the Guilt of it.</p>
               <p>But ≈øome Prote≈øtant Expo≈øitor preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced again≈øt this Doctrine, have utterly changed the Sen≈øe of our Saviour in this Speech, which they will not allow to be de≈øigned by him for any Direction or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the means of Clean≈øing men from the Guilt of ≈øin: But to be ≈øpoken Ironically in reference to a common Opinion and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Jews,

               <p>I ≈øhall add but one Text more out of the New Te≈øtament; <hi>viz.</hi> that of St. <hi>Paul, Hebr.</hi> 13.16. <hi>To do good, and to di≈øtribute forget not, for with ≈øuch Sacrifices God is well plea≈øed:</hi> Where I ≈øhall not in≈øi≈øt upon the Latine Tran≈ølations, which may ≈øeem more expre≈ø≈øly to favour our Doctrine, by the words <hi>promeretur,</hi> vulg. <hi>placatur,</hi> vel <hi>conciliatur,</hi> ≈øignifying God to be <hi>appea≈øed, reconciled</hi> and <hi>made friends</hi> by works of Charity: But content my ≈øelf with our Engli≈øh Tran≈ølation, mo≈øt literally agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>HAving now ≈øufficiently (as we think) confirmed the General Doctrine, founded upon this Text of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> we are to proceed according to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe to the an≈øwering ≈øome Objections, which have been or may be made again≈øt this Sence of the words. And I ≈øhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that which ≈øeems to be mo≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable,</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Objection.</hi> Namely, that the≈øe words of the Apo≈øtle are quoted, or borrowed from a Proverb of Solomons, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Hatred ≈øtirreth up ≈øtrife, but love covereth all ≈øins.</hi> Where by the Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis of the two parts of the Sentence, it is pa≈øt all doubt, that the ≈øins to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by love, mu≈øt be the ≈øins of others, and not of the Charitable Per≈øon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> To this may be an≈øwered. 1. That it is no way evident, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle did intend any quotation of that Proverb, there being no ≈øuch intimation thereof in this Text, as is u≈øual in other quotations out of the Old Te≈øtament, by tho≈øe words, <hi>as it is written,</hi> or the like,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43236:51"/>u≈øed by this ≈øame Apo≈øtle in this Epi≈øtle, Chap. 1.16. <hi>Becau≈øe it is written, be ye Holy, as I am Holy.</hi> And as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he doth not quote the whole Proverb, whiles he leaves out the fir≈øt part, <hi>Hatred ≈øtirreth up ≈øtrife;</hi> ≈øo, that he doth not cite the ≈øecond part verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, is plain, by comparing the Texts. Whereof one ≈øaith, <hi>love covereth all ≈øins,</hi> the other only <hi>a multitude of ≈øins.</hi> But in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> which is generally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in quotations out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament, in the New, a far greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is found, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>. So it is in the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> not agreeing ≈øo much as in one word with St. <hi>Peters</hi> ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed quotation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>. The Hebrew Text indeed is ≈øomething more agreeable to St. <hi>Peters</hi> words.</p>
               <p>But then 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Suppo≈øe that the Apo≈øtle did allude unto the words of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb (as is not improbable) it doth not therefore follow that he intended the ≈øame Sence, it being very u≈øual with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our him≈øelf, and the Evangeli≈øts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles, by way of accommodation, to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43236:52"/>make u≈øe of Texts and Sayings in the Old Te≈øtament, in a different Sence from that which did belong to them there. As in <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.15. and 23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.15. and el≈øewhere frequently. And this An≈øwer I take to be ≈øufficient for this fir≈øt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection again≈øt our Interpretation of St. <hi>Peters</hi> words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Objection.</hi> But another main Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that which is mo≈øt like to be in≈øi≈øted upon again≈øt this Interpretation, is, that it ≈øeems to favour the Popi≈øh Doctrines of Merit, Satisfaction and Ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Works, and to be repugnant to the Evangelical Doctrine of the mo≈øt full, perfect, and ≈øufficient Expiation, and Satisfaction for the ≈øins of the whole World, made only by the Sacrifice of Chri≈øts death, and applied only by Faith. The covering and pardon of ≈øin, is the Effect of Gods grace granted only upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of Chri≈øts death, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a true Faith in him wrought by the Spirit of God through the hearing of the Go≈øpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> To this Objection I an≈øwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That although ≈øome Papi≈øts interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Text as I do, may be found to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43236:52"/>alledge it among other Texts, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of ≈øome of the Doctrines men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Objection; yet neither is this Sen≈øe vouched by all Interpreters of their Profe≈ø≈øion; nor can any of tho≈øe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines be further evinced, or confirmed from this Text, ≈øo under≈øtood, then it may be from other Texts before alledged for the Confirmation of the Doctrine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt which the Objection is made. Nor is the free grace of God, or the ≈øufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that Expiation, or Satisfaction which was made by the death of Chri≈øt, any more abated by this Doctrine, than it is by that which all the forementioned Texts import.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The words <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> are known to have been familiarly u≈øed, in reference to Good Works, by the mo≈øt ancient of the <hi>Latin Fathers,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (one of the mo≈øt Primitive) in a Catholick Orthodox Sen≈øe. Both the words are Innocent in the Sen≈øe of the Fathers, though they have been perverted by the Schoolmen.</p>
               <p>And Ju≈øtification by Works is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as true in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Sence, as 'tis fal≈øe in St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> The late Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43236:53"/>that have been concerning the≈øe Points, do not ≈øo much re≈øpect the words, as the extravagant Sen≈øe, that hath been put upon them by the Schoolmen, who have intangled and corrupted a great part of Chri≈øtian Doctrine, by their misinterpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fathers: determining the ≈øimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Popular Expre≈ø≈øions, by their own Capricious and Litigious Conceits, into ≈øuch Dogmatical Sen≈øe, as was never thought of by the Antients. But in the particular Controver≈øies about Merit, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and Ju≈øtification by Works, there hath been ≈øo much of Logomachy, or word-bate, as might (in my opinion) be fairly compromi≈øed, or accorded by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Arbitratours, who≈øe minds were free from all prejudice, but that again≈øt Contention and Divi≈øion: and were more zealous for Unity and Concord, than for di≈øputable and opinionative Truth. But for to undertake that task in this place would not be rea≈øonable.</p>
               <p>That all Pardon of ≈øin is founded upon the Expiation, or Propitiation made by the Bloud of Chri≈øt, and granted, or obtained only by the Free Grace of God, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by any Sect or Party of Chri≈øtians,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43236:53"/>that I know of. Although ≈øome Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences have been about the Conditions of this Grant. For to ≈øay, that this Grace is granted without any Condition or Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Receiver, is, in my Judgment, to deny a great part of the Scriptures, as well of the New Te≈øtament, as of the Old, de≈øtructive as well of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as of the Old: no more Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian than Anti-evangelical.</p>
               <p>Doubtle≈øs it is of Free Grace that God will pardon a ≈øinner, upon any Condition, Nor is it po≈ø≈øible for us to do any thing, ≈øufficient to make Satisfaction for our ≈øins, or to merit the Forgivene≈øs of them, in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of Ju≈øtice, becau≈øe all that is in our Power to do, is no more then our Duty, if God requires it. And all that we do, is much le≈øs. And as the duty of Well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the utmo≈øt Extent, is a ju≈øt Debt of Thankfulne≈øs at lea≈øt, if not of Preceptive Obligation to Almighty God, to whom we owe our ≈øelves, and all that we have or can do. So the Puni≈øhment we are liable to for neglecting our Duty, or acting contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto in our Evil doings, is another Debt, by our Saviours account ≈øignified to us in that Form of Prayer which he hath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43236:54"/>taught us to u≈øe: <hi>Forgive us our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors, Mat.</hi> 6.12. But it is altogether unrea≈øonable one Debt can be di≈øcharged by the Payment of another, e≈øpecially when the Payment falls ≈øo much ≈øhort of the old Debt, as it doth in any thing we do. Be≈øides that upon a due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Charity it ≈øelf, and every Good Work that can be done by us; doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe our debt to God, becau≈øe it cannot be done without his Grace.</p>
               <p>Neverthele≈øs God of his Free Grace hath promi≈øed the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions declared in his Word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt which, this of Charity is one, that by a common Synechdoche of a Part for the Whole, includes all the re≈øt. And whereas in the New Te≈øtament Faith in Chri≈øt is more commonly propounded, as the Condition of Ju≈øtification, importing the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, it is to be con≈øidered, that this Faith is ≈øo far from excluding Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it is expre≈ø≈øly ≈øaid to include it, by St. <hi>Paul</hi> him≈øelf, the ≈øuppo≈øed Author of the Doctrine of Ju≈øtification by Faith without Works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For in Chri≈øt Je≈øus neither Circumci≈øion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ncircumci≈øion, but Faith which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43236:54"/>worketh by Love.</hi>

And ≈øuch is the nece≈ø≈øity of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43236:55"/>this Charity, by the Doctrine of the ≈øame Apo≈øtle, that he el≈øewhere ≈øaith, <hi>Though I have all Faith, ≈øo that I could remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.

                  </gap>, or <hi>extraordinary Gift of the Faith of Miracles,</hi> whereof he ≈øpeaks in the former Chapter ver. 12.</p>
               <p>To this Purpo≈øe St. <hi>James</hi> Chap. 2.22. ≈øaith, <hi>Faith is made perfect by Works;</hi> not excluding any ≈øort of Good Works, but ≈øpecially treating of the works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as appears by the Context, from ver≈øe the 13. to the 18. And whereas he ≈øaith, <hi>Faith is made perfect by Works,</hi> he ≈øpeaks not only of a Gradual Perfection, or of the Con≈øummation or Pre≈øervation of Faith, or of the Ornament, Demon≈øtration, or ≈øignal evidence of Faith, as ≈øome would have it; but of ≈øuch an e≈ø≈øential and formal Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as is nece≈ø≈øary to the nature of Truth, and ≈øincerity of Faith, as appears by that repeated Sentence, both before and after the≈øe Words, ver. 17. <hi>Faith without Works is dead,</hi> and ver. 26. <hi>As the Body without
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43236:55"/>the Spirit is dead; ≈øo Faith without Works is dead al≈øo.</hi> Whether by <hi>the Spirit</hi> he means <hi>the Breath</hi> (as ≈øome take it, becau≈øe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Spiritus,</hi> ≈øometime ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more) or rather <hi>the Soul,</hi> which is the mo≈øt u≈øual Sen≈øe of the word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Meaning comes all to one, ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that an idle or fruitle≈øs Faith hath no more of Spiritual Life or Reality in it, than a Body can have without Breath, or without a Soul: and therefore is no more a true and unfeigned Faith, than a dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øs is a human Body.</p>
               <p>Indeed the true ju≈øtifying, ≈øaving Faith in the practical Notion, which is the only true Notion of it, includes Charity, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all other Good Works, as I have el≈øewhere largely ≈øhewed: So that if Faith be nece≈ø≈øary to the Covering or Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, Charity is ≈øo too. But the common An≈øwer to the≈øe, and all other Texts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to evince the Nece≈ø≈øity of Charity and Good Works, to the Salvation of a ≈øinner, is, that they prove only <hi>a nece≈ø≈øity of Pre≈øence and Concomitancy,</hi> or at mo≈øt <hi>a nece≈ø≈øity of Con≈øequence,</hi> not <hi>of Efficacy,</hi> that is, that this Nece≈ø≈øity doth not re≈øpect <hi>the End or Effect</hi> of Faith, in the Ju≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43236:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>or Salvation of the Believeer, but proceeds only from the common nature and principle of that Faith, which is an effect of the Spirit of God: the nece≈ø≈øary Fruits whereof do con≈øi≈øt in Love, Joy, Peace, Long-≈øuffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which di≈øtinct Vertues, with their proper Works, do not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing to the Effect of our Ju≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but are meer Concomitants, or at mo≈øt but gratefull Effects of that Faith which ju≈øtifieth us. Which u≈øeth to be illu≈øtrated by a Similitude borrowed from the natural and animal Life, wherein the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faculties of Seeing, or taking hold of a thing by the Touch, do nece≈ø≈øarily imply ≈øuch a common Principle of ≈øen≈øitive Life, as doth al≈øo comprehend the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Hearing, Smelling and Ta≈øting, yet none of the≈øe Faculties, or any act of them do, or can contribute any thing effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to the effect of Seeing, Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or laying hold of an Object: So the Grace of Charity, or Love to God, and Man, together with all tho≈øe other Fruits of the Spirit, which are mentioned by the Apo≈øtle, and all the Effects and Works, which do proceed from them, are indeed nece≈ø≈øary Concomitants of ≈øuch a Faith, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43236:56"/>ju≈øtifies or ≈øaves a Man, but do contribute no more, nor have any more Efficacy to this effect of Ju≈øtification and Salvation, than the di≈øtinct Faculties of other Sen≈øes, do to the effect of Seeing. This I take to be a true Account of their Sen≈øe, that a≈ø≈øert the Doctrine of Ju≈øtification, and Pardon of ≈øin by Faith only, as that imports a habit, or act really di≈øtinct, though not ≈øeparated from other Chri≈øtian Vertues.</p>
               <p>In oppo≈øition to this Opinion contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine which I maintain to be the Sen≈øe of the Apo≈øtle in this Text, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as hath been ≈øeen, by many others, I am engaged to prove that Charity, and Good Works are nece≈ø≈øary to the Ju≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ≈øinner, that is, to the Remi≈ø≈øion of his ≈øin, not only by way of Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, or joint Pre≈øence with Faith, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequent to it, but al≈øo by way of moral Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy as a Condition or Means to obtain that Effect.</p>
               <p>This I hope will be ≈øufficiently done by the following Arguments, this one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtulate or conclu≈øion (which I ≈øuppo≈øe will not be denied) being fir≈øt granted me, <hi>viz.</hi> That if any thing el≈øe be≈øide the habit or act of Faith, con≈øidered as really di≈øtinct
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43236:57"/>from other Chri≈øtian Vertues or Acts, be effectual or available to the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, then Charity is, or may be ≈øo, in as much as that is one of the mo≈øt Excellent of Chri≈øtian Vertues, mo≈øt agreeable to the Nature of God, and con≈øequently mo≈øt plea≈øing to him. So that if that be not available to this End, nothing el≈øe be≈øides Faith, can be ≈øo. This Propo≈øition being granted, I argue as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Argument.</hi> If it be certain from Scripture, and we be bound to believe, that nothing which can be done by us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides ≈øuch a Faith, as is ≈øuppo≈øed to be really di≈øtinct (though not ≈øeparate) from all Good Works, can be of any Efficacy towards the remi≈ø≈øion of our ≈øins, then ought nothing el≈øe to be done by us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that end, becau≈øe every ≈øuch other act done to this end, would by this ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition be perfectly vain and unrea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not ≈øo only, but al≈øo contrary to our obliged belief. And then to pray for the forgivene≈øs of our ≈øins, that being an act di≈øtinct from Faith, would be not only needle≈øs and u≈øele≈øs, but unlawful; e≈øpecially if it ≈øhould be acted with any opinion, hope, or belief, that ≈øuch a prayer
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43236:57"/>could avail us any thing in order to this end, or that this end could any way be promoted by our Prayers. But this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to our Saviours Precept in that Form of Prayer, which he hath taught us to u≈øe, wherein we are directed to pray, that God will <hi>forgive us our tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, as we forgive them that tre≈øpa≈øs again≈øt us.</hi> And contrary to the advice of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8.22. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent therefore of this thy wickedne≈øs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where al≈øo it is to be noted, that the Apo≈øtle advi≈øeth him not only to pray for the forgivene≈øs of his ≈øin, but al≈øo to repent of it in order to the ≈øame end. The ≈øame advice is given by the ≈øame Apo≈øtle to the Jews in the fir≈øt Sermon which he made unto them, after the reception of the Holy Gho≈øt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving convinced them of their hainous ≈øin in the murder of the Lord Je≈øus, and made them ≈øen≈øible of it: <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts, and ≈øaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>and the re≈øt of the Apo≈øtles, men and brethren, what ≈øhall we do. Then</hi> Peter <hi>≈øaid unto them, repent and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43236:58"/>be baptizid every one of you, in the name of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, for the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins.</hi> Where 'tis ob≈øervable, that whiles two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are pre≈øcribed by the Apo≈øtle to be done, in order to the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, <hi>viz. to repent,</hi> and <hi>to be baptized,</hi> no mention is made of Faith, other then is included in tho≈øe words, <hi>be baptized in the name of Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> which do indeed nece≈ø≈øarily imply the act of Faith. But be≈øides this Bapti≈øm, which is one thing required to be done for the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, Repentance al≈øo, which is another thing, is expre≈øsly required, as nece≈ø≈øary to this end: not in that Text only, but in an hundred others of both Te≈øtaments, from whence it is that this remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin is mentioned as the ≈øignal effect of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.3. <hi>John</hi> is ≈øaid to have preached the <hi>Bapti≈øm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin.</hi> And in the Conjunction of the≈øe two things, the Sum of the Go≈øpel to be preached to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is compri≈øed by our Saviour in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 24.47. <hi>That Repentance and Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin ≈øhould be preached in his Name to all Nations.</hi> Hence al≈øo is the ≈øame called <hi>Repentance unto Life, Acts.</hi> 11.18.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43236:58"/>and <hi>Repentance to Salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.</p>
               <p>From which Texts it doth ≈øufficiently appear, not only that Repentance is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary unto the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, and to Life and Salvation, as a Condition, or <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øa ≈øine qu√¢ non,</hi> but that it is al≈øo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and really available to the≈øe Ends: For to call that <hi>Repentance unto Life,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Salvation,</hi> which contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, nor hath any manner of Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to the≈øe Ends, is an ab≈øurd Form of words. And if the Prepo≈øition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>unto,</hi> doth not ≈øignifie ≈øome kind of Efficacy, or Qualification for the≈øe Ends, it ≈øignifies ju≈øt nothing. But if it doth ≈øignifie any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Efficacy to this End, one of the≈øe Things mu≈øt needs be true: either that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the ≈øame thing with that Faith, which ab≈øtracts from Works, as an Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally di≈øtinct from them all, which is a plain Contradiction: or that ≈øomething be≈øides Faith, and really di≈øtinct from it, is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and available to the Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, which is the thing that was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrated.</p>
               <p>Thus I have named <hi>two Things be≈øides Faith,</hi> which are generally nece≈ø≈øary to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43236:59"/>of ≈øin, <hi>viz. Prayer</hi> and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Whereunto might be added the practice of Fa≈øting, Mourning, Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Confe≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, as things fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned in Scripture, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription to their u≈øe, in order to this end. I forbear to cite the particular Texts, wherein the≈øe things are pre≈øcribed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are all but <hi>appendages, or parts of the general duty of Repentance.</hi> Nor are the≈øe things nece≈ø≈øary to this effect barely, and only by their antecedent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, as meet and convenient preparatives for this Grace of Pardon, but al≈øo by, and in re≈øpect of ≈øuch a Moral Efficacy, and Prevalency, as they are ju≈øtly pre≈øumed to have, by their declared acceptance with God, which is all the Efficacy that can be rea≈øonably attributed to Faith it ≈øelf. And if upon the ≈øtre≈øs of this Argument, it ≈øhould be ≈øaid that Faith in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sen≈øe, as a living energetical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive habit, doth include Repentance, with all the proper fruits thereof, the whole Que≈øtion is yielded. For then to ≈øay, that Faith is available for the remi≈ø≈øion, or covering of ≈øin, is to ≈øay, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Prayer, Charity, and Good Works
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43236:59"/>are ≈øo too, which is all we contend for. It being far from our meaning to exclude Faith from any nece≈ø≈øary concurrence to this effect of Charity, that is to ≈øay, that Charity without Faith can cover ≈øin. For neither can Chri≈øtian Charity be without Faith, nor if it could, would it be any wi≈øe effectual to this end. The only thing that we a≈ø≈øert is, that Charity together with Faith, and as a proper, and mo≈øt Excellent Fruit of it, is available to this end. And the ≈øumm of the Argument, which we have here urged to confirm this A≈ø≈øertion is this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if nothing but Faith can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to this end, then ought nothing to be done in order to it, but believing. And Prayer, Repentance, Humiliation, and Confe≈ø≈øion of ≈øin (notwith≈øtanding that in Scripture they be all pre≈øcribed, as means to be u≈øed to this end) are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly u≈øele≈øs, or needle≈øs, but unlawfull to be practi≈øed with re≈øpect to this end. Or ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that if any of the≈øe things be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to this purpo≈øe, ≈øo al≈øo is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This is our fir≈øt Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Argument.</hi> If Charity and Good Works of any ≈øort be not available to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43236:60"/>the obtainment of remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, Eternal Life, and Salvation; then do all promi≈øes of the≈øe Benefits made to the u≈øe and exerci≈øe of the≈øe means, ≈øignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or at lea≈øt they mu≈øt needs lo≈øe all power and ≈øignification of Motives to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the≈øe Duties. For how can that be con≈øidered as a rea≈øonable Motive to any act, which doth no way promote it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the General De≈øign and end of all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promi≈øes,</hi> is to encourage, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade, and move the Per≈øons to whom they are made, to the performance of tho≈øe Conditions and Acts which are recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the re≈øpective Promi≈øes, upon the hope of obtaining the promi≈øed Benefits, by tho≈øe means. But this hope can have no foundation, without the believing, that the performance of tho≈øe Conditions will be ≈øome ways effectual to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the≈øe Benefits. But if the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ≈øuch Acts and Conditions mu≈øt be believed to contribute nothing at all to the obtainment of the≈øe Benefits, the forementioned Faith in the Promi≈øes, which is the only foundation of the hope, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly de≈øtroyed. And by con≈øequence the ≈øaid Promi≈øes are deprived of all Vertue,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43236:60"/>or power of Motives, to the practices whereunto they are annexed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Argument.</hi> All Precepts, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Coun≈øels (≈øuch as that in our Text) to the practice of Charity, or any other Chri≈øtian Vertue, be≈øide Faith, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ≈øuch Motives as are no ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the Acts whereunto we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, are vain, and delu≈øory. Were ≈øuch Precepts and Exhortations delivered ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ab≈øolutely, as only declarative of our Duty, or de≈øigned only to move Men to their Duties, as Te≈øtimonies of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude or Thankfulne≈øs for tho≈øe Benefits, which we receive only by Faith (as ≈øome late Divines would have them) they would indeed be rea≈øonable upon that account. But when they are expre≈øsly urged, as in this Text, and many others they are, to move Men to the Practice of particular Duties, as means to obtain the propo≈øed Benefits, what can they ≈øignifie, but a plain impo≈øing upon us, or abu≈øing our minds, and perverting our Faith, ≈øuppo≈øing that the doing of tho≈øe things, whereto we are exhorted, can nothing avail us to tho≈øe ends? What can ≈øuch Exhortations ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie more then if a man ≈øhould be per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43236:61"/>to ≈øtretch forth his hands to behold the Glory of the Heavens, or to open his eyes to hear the ≈øweet Melody of Mu≈øick.</p>
               <p>But the force of the≈øe Arguments is by many late Divines thought to be ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently avoided, by alledging, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, that Faith is the only thing, that is effectual to Ju≈øtification, or remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, and that no other Act or Vertue can contribute any thing to this end, yet neither are the forementioned Promi≈øes, nor the Exhortations void, or u≈øele≈øs in reference to this effect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becau≈øe there is a Nece≈ø≈øity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, though not of efficacy, of tho≈øe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acts and Vertues, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Promi≈øes and Exhortations.

               <p>Another verbal eva≈øion of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which are produced for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual concurrence of Charity and Good Works to the attainment of the great Benefits of final Ju≈øtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath been vulgarly expre≈ø≈øed by that trite ≈øaying of the Latin Father, <hi>Bernard. Bona opera ≈øunt via ad regnum, non cau≈øa regnandi, Good Works are indeed the way to the kingdom of Heaven, but not the cau≈øe of reigning.</hi> Which words applied to the Doctrine by us grounded upon the words of the Apo≈øtle, mu≈øt have this Sen≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> That Charity is the way to obtain the covering, or non-imputation of ≈øin, but no cau≈øe of it, <hi>i. e,</hi> a means, but not a cau≈øe; a very nice di≈øtinction, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered further hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:43236:62"/>
               <p>This I take to be a ju≈øt account of the chief An≈øwers, that have been made to the premi≈øed Arguments, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes and exhortations of Scripture, for the efficacy or validity of Charity and Good Works, unto the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, and the Salvation of a ≈øinner.</p>
               <p>Now in order to a ≈øufficient reply to the≈øe An≈øwers, I think it nece≈ø≈øary in this place to ≈øay ≈øomething by way of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Que≈øtion (tending to the clearing of the true Sen≈øe, and meaning of the Doctrine) what is meant by that Efficacy, which any act, that can be done by men, may have towards the remi≈ø≈øion of their ≈øins, their Ju≈øtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that all the≈øe things are the proper and peculiar Acts and Effects of God him≈øelf, who is the agent of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cau≈øe of them all. And therefore 'tis impo≈ø≈øible that any Humane Act ≈øhould have any direct or immediate influence, or efficiency upon the≈øe Effects. <hi>Who can forgive ≈øins, but God?</hi> And 'tis God that ju≈øtifies, and ≈øaves actively. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Efficacy that can be in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Acts towards the≈øe effects, can be no
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43236:63"/>more than <hi>preparative</hi> or <hi>pa≈ø≈øive.</hi> And what can that ≈øignifie more, than that they are certain Di≈øpo≈øitions and Qualifications of the Patient, or Subject to receive the≈øe Effects of Divine Grace. Nor can Faith it ≈øelf have any other influence or efficacy upon the≈øe Effects, any more than Charity. Faith it ≈øelf doth neither pardon our ≈øin, or contribute any thing to that Divine Act, by which we are pardoned. Neither doth qualifie or ≈øave us, any otherwi≈øe then by making ≈øuch a Change or Qualification in us, whereupon this Grace of Ju≈øtification to Life, is freely given us of God.</p>
               <p>But again≈øt this Explication of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Faith, to the Grace of Ju≈øtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it hath been alledged, that Faith in Chri≈øt doth not ju≈øtifie as an act or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation found in us, but as it hath a peculiar Vertue, not common to Charity, or any other Act of ours; and that is of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending and receiving Chri≈øt, or uniting us to him, and ≈øo making us Partakers of his Righteou≈øne≈øs imputed to us, by means whereof we come to be Ju≈øtified, our ≈øins Covered, and our Souls ≈øaved.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I an≈øwer. 1. By allowing an union of Believers with Chri≈øt the common
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43236:63"/>Saviour, to be indeed the true ground and foundation of the Benefits which we receive by him. And that this Union is not barely <hi>Relative</hi> or <hi>Political,</hi> ≈øuch as is betwixt a King, Lord or Husband, and their re≈øpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Subjects, Servants and Wives. Nor only <hi>Pactional,</hi> imputed and founded upon the Promi≈øe or Covenant of the Go≈øpel, to them that believe in him; but a true and real Union effected by the <hi>Medium</hi> of the Holy Spirit, communicated to them that believe, and are baptized into the Faith of Chri≈øt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> ver. 11. of the ≈øame Chapter, <hi>But ye are wa≈øhed, but ye are ≈øanctified, but ye are ju≈øtified, in the Name of the Lord Je≈øus, and by the Spirit of God.</hi> Rom. 8.12. <hi>If any man hath not the Spirit of Chri≈øt, the ≈øame is none of his.</hi> This <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chri≈øt</hi> is ordinarily called <hi>the Spirit of God, abiding or dwelling in all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, whereby they are partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øpeaketh) as Chri≈øt al≈øo was,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16. 1 Cor. 8.19. 2 Pet. 1.4.</note> though not in the ≈øame mea≈øure and manner. Such a real
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43236:64"/>Union there is between Chri≈øt the Head; and all true Believers, Members of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as there is between the head and members of a natural Body, partaking of one and the ≈øame natural Spirit. Nor do we deny but that Faith is the fir≈øt Act that di≈øpo≈øeth a Man to the <hi>Receipt</hi> of this Divine Spirit dwelling in him, whereby it may be ≈øaid to effect, or procure our Union with Chri≈øt, whereby we partake, both of the Nature, and the Effects and Benefits of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs.</p>
               <p>But the imputation of Chri≈øts Righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to us is no Scriptural Phra≈øe, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers very much from that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerting not the Righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt, but Faith (working by Charity) to be imputed for Righteou≈øne≈øs to them that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 24. But if it be the act or habit of Faith, which is imputed to us for Righteou≈øne≈øs, according to the expre≈øs literal Sen≈øe of the Apo≈øtles words, then 'tis not the Per≈øonal Righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt, that is imputed to us; for our Faith is no part of his Righteou≈øne≈øs. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Phra≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øts Righteou≈øne≈øs imputed to us,</hi> hath been commonly u≈øed by Divines of very good Note, among≈øt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43236:64"/>Prote≈øtants, (though no man can be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to admit it in a ≈øtrict Sen≈øe, it being not found in Scripture) yet I think, for Peace ≈øake, it ≈øhould not be ab≈øolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, much le≈øs with any reflections of Reproach or Di≈øparagement to them that have u≈øed it, but rather admitted in ≈øuch a Candid Sen≈øe, as it may fairly bear. As if the Son of a Prince, or ≈øome other Per≈øon of Great Merit and Favour with him, ≈øhould undertake to be Mediator for ≈øome Rebel, that had ju≈øtly incurred the Di≈øplea≈øure of his Prince, and rendred him≈øelf obnoxious to the highe≈øt penalty of Law, ≈øhould of his own Good Will, by the Appointment and Will of the Prince, act or ≈øuffer ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for, and on the behalf of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, and thereby obtain, by the Grace of the Prince, a free Pardon for him, under ≈øome equitable Conditions required of the Delinquent. In this ca≈øe the Merits, Act and Sufferings of ≈øuch a Mediator might, in a rea≈øonable Sen≈øe, be ≈øaid to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Redeemed Per≈øon. Such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this Phra≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs imputed to us,</hi> I think ≈øhould not be quarrel'd, but may fairly agree with the Scripture phra≈øes of <hi>Propitiation, Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43236:65"/>and Attonement of Chri≈øt made for us,</hi> and with the Di≈øcour≈øe of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. from the 15 Ver≈øe to the end of the Chapter. Other Sen≈øes there are of this Phra≈øe in≈øi≈øted upon by ≈øome Divines, which cannot be maintained without gro≈øs, and ab≈øurd Con≈øequences, as hath been ≈øhewed by ≈øome that have lately written ≈øharply concerning this Point.</p>
               <p>This Explication of the Que≈øtion, what is meant by that Efficacy, which any act, that can be done by us, towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of our ≈øins, or our Ju≈øtification can have, being premi≈øed, and cleared from the mo≈øt u≈øual Objections again≈øt it; I proceed in my Reply to the fore-mentioned An≈øwer to the Arguments, for the Confirmation of the Doctrine in hand, drawn from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes and Exhortations of Scripture, as followeth.</p>
               <p>To the Fir≈øt part of that An≈øwer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging only the nece≈ø≈øity of Pre≈øence of Charity and Good Works, together with Faith (in order to the obtainment of the Benefits propounded) as a ≈øufficient Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the u≈øe of tho≈øe Motives, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ≈øaid Promi≈øes and Exhortations; I reply, by demanding whether the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43236:65"/>and Good Works, ≈øuppo≈øed to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, do concurr to the Qualification of the Per≈øon that is to receive the≈øe Benefits or not: If they do concurr, as any Part of the Qualification of the Per≈øon, for the <hi>Receipt</hi> of tho≈øe Benefits, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Explication of the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Que≈øtion, but that they are as truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to the <hi>Obtainment</hi> of tho≈øe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, as Faith, or any thing el≈øe can be.

Nor can tho≈øe Advantages, or Benefits be any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable Motives to ≈øuch Actions, whiles they are ≈øuppo≈øed to contribute nothing at all to the <hi>Obtainment</hi> of them.

               <p>And therefore it hath been ≈øaid, that although Charity and Good Works, be in them≈øelves of no Validity, or Efficacy to the Covering of ≈øin, Ju≈øtification, or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a ≈øinner, nor do contribute any thing towards the Obtaining of the≈øe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, yet they have the nature of a <hi>Cau≈øa ≈øine qu√¢ non,</hi> that is, <hi>of ≈øomething, without which a thing is not to be effected or gained,</hi> but if that Something hath no manner of Cau≈øality at all in it, it cannot be called a <hi>Cau≈øa ≈øine qu√¢ non,</hi> without a real Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Terms. For to be a Cau≈øe, without which a thing cannot be, and yet to have no manner of Cau≈øality, in reference to the Effect, is to be a Cau≈øe and no Cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe the de≈øign of the Holy Gho≈øt in the forementioned Promi≈øes, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations had been (as we really ≈øuppo≈øe it was) to in≈øtruct men what they ≈øhould do, or what things po≈ø≈øible to be done by them, would be available to the ends
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43236:66"/>propounded. I demand how ≈øuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign could have been expre≈ø≈øed, more ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly then it is by the Terms u≈øed in the Exhortations and Promi≈øes alledged. And as for the bare nece≈ø≈øity of pre≈øence of Charity and Good Works, together with Faith in the Per≈øons which are to be ju≈øtified and ≈øaved, that's no more then is equally true of the faculties of Life, Sen≈øe, and Rea≈øon, there being a perfect nece≈ø≈øity of the pre≈øence of all the≈øe things to the act of Faith, which is ≈øuppo≈øed to be the only thing that ju≈øtifies a man. But would it therefore be rea≈øonable to exhort men to take care to pre≈øerve the≈øe faculties in order to their Ju≈øtification, or might the Promi≈øes of Pardon of Sin, Life, and Salvation be rea≈øonably annexed to ≈øuch a care of pre≈øerving the≈øe Faculties, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare account of their nece≈ø≈øary pre≈øence, or concomitancy, with a ju≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith.</p>
               <p>Now where it hath been ≈øaid, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Good Works are nece≈ø≈øary to the verification of that Faith, by which we are ju≈øtified, <hi>i. e.</hi> to declare and manife≈øt the truth of it, but have otherwi≈øe no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Efficacy to the Ju≈øtification of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43236:67"/>Believer, and that is a ≈øufficient account of the rea≈øonablene≈øs of all Promi≈øes made to the habit and exerci≈øe of this Vertue, as al≈øo of the Exhortations before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. I an≈øwer, that if indeed the≈øe things be nece≈ø≈øary to the verification of that Faith that ju≈øtifies us, ≈øo as to con≈øtitute and make up the Truth and Validity thereof, and thereby to declare the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy thereof, the Que≈øtion is really yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And the≈øe things mu≈øt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have a concurrent Efficacy to the forementioned Effect, which is all that is contended for.</p>
               <p>But if by the verification of Faith no more be meant, then a bare manife≈øtation of the truth of it, by the Signs and Fruits of it, that is the ≈øame thing with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer allegation, concerning the nece≈ø≈øity or u≈øefulne≈øs of the≈øe things, for the A≈ø≈øurance of a mans Ju≈øtification or Salvation. But whether this be the true intent, or only meaning of the Promi≈øes, and Exhortations made to the≈øe Practices, I appeal to the Judgment of any Unprejudiced Reader, that ≈øhall review, and con≈øider the expre≈øs Terms and Forms of Words u≈øed in them.</p>
               <p>When we pray for the Forgivene≈øs of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43236:67"/>our ≈øins, mu≈øt this be the only Meaning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>r not that God will be plea≈øed to forgive us, upon any con≈øideration of our Prayers, but that he will give us an A≈ø≈øurance, that he hath forgiven us? I appeal to the Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any of them, that make this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (to ≈øerve an Hypothe≈øis, which they have unwarily e≈øpou≈øed) whether this hath been, or is their own Sen≈øe in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Pardon of their ≈øin. Which is no other, then if a Criminal, petitioning a King for his Pardon, ≈øhould thereby intend not to obtain it, but only to be a≈ø≈øured that it was granted. When our Saviour promi≈øeth, that <hi>if we will forgive Men their Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, our Heavenly Father will al≈øo forgive us our Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes,</hi> is that his only Meaning, that our Forgiving others ≈øhall be to us a ≈øign, and evidence that we are forgiven, but no Means to obtain that Forgivene≈øs? When we are exhorted to Repentance for the Remi≈ø≈øion of our ≈øins, which was the common Doctrine of the Prophets, of <hi>John</hi> Bapti≈øt, our Ble≈ø≈øed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Apo≈øtles, and particularly of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in an≈øwer to the Que≈øtion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> what they ≈øhould do to be ≈øaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. was this their Meaning, not to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43236:68"/>teach Men to repent, to that end that they might be ≈øaved, and their ≈øins be forgiven them, but that they might be a≈ø≈øured that their ≈øins were forgiven them? I de≈øire any Indifferent Reader, that is not pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly bent to maintain a Prejudice again≈øt all Appearance of Rea≈øon, to apply this Meaning to the Promi≈øes, Exhortations, and A≈ø≈øertions of Scripture, which have been before alledged to this Purpo≈øe, and then to judge, whether all, or any of them be to be interpreted to this Sence. And if they be, I demand why the ≈øame promi≈øes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtification, Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made to the act of Faith, may not, or ≈øhould not admit of the ≈øame Interpretation (as ≈øome of the Antinomians have contended) <hi>viz.</hi> that Faith it ≈øelf contributes nothing at all to any of the≈øe Effects or Benefits, that are thereunto promi≈øed, or is any Means or Condition of obtaining them, but only a ≈øign or means to a≈ø≈øure us of our Intere≈øt in them.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, I demand, whether any thing po≈ø≈øible to be done by us, doth ≈øerve to qualifie us for the <hi>Reception</hi> of tho≈øe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, by the Grace of God, or be of any Validity, or moral Efficacy towards the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:43236:68"/>of the≈øe Ends? If not, then Faith can be of no more Efficacy to this purpo≈øe then Charity. But if any Act or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is po≈ø≈øible to be performed by us, be any ways effectual or available to the≈øe Ends, why may not Charity, (e≈øpecially as a fruit and effect of Faith) be conceived to have a concurrent Efficacy with Faith, or ≈øubordinate to it, agreeable to the many promi≈øes of the ≈øame Benefits made to Charity and Good Works, as well as to Faith? And ≈øeeing that it is, and mu≈øt be ever acknowledged, that it is only of the free Grace of God, that Faith is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as any condition, qualification, or means of obtaining the≈øe Benefits; Seeing al≈øo, that Charity, in the proper nature of it, is the mo≈øt Excellent, and mo≈øt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vertue, mo≈øt conformable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God him≈øelf, and therefore ≈øaid to be the greate≈øt of the three Chri≈øtian Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. Is it not very rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe that ≈øuch a quality mo≈øt Divine, expre≈ø≈øing both the Nature and Image of God, and being al≈øo the Effect of his own free Grace, ≈øhould be accepted as part of that di≈øpo≈øition in us, that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies us for his Favour and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43236:69"/>merited only by the Expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and Obedience of his Son, always acknowledged by our Faith in him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all confidence in any thing that we can do, as acceptable upon any other account, then of his Meritorious Meciation?</p>
               <p>Other rea≈øons are given by Modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Prote≈øtant Party, concerning the nece≈ø≈øity of Charity and Good Works, exclu≈øive of this we contend for; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the≈øe things are nece≈ø≈øary <hi>nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate praecepti, non medii, i. e.</hi> nece≈ø≈øary parts of our Duty, in obedience to the Law, or Will of God, not nece≈ø≈øary means of Salvation, or obtaining the Benefit of remi≈ø≈øion of our ≈øins, nece≈ø≈øary to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øed, in order to the plea≈øing of God, the Glorifying and Honouring of his Name, to expre≈øs our Thankfulne≈øs to him for all his Benefits, e≈øpecially for his Free Grace of Redemption and Ju≈øtification, procured by the merits of Chri≈øt: As al≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to adorn our Holy Profe≈ø≈øion, the Honour of Chri≈øt and his Go≈øpel, to give Good Example, and avoid Scandal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which are without Exception to be acknowledged, for ju≈øt Rea≈øons of our Duty: But do fignifie nothing to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43236:69"/>the Que≈øtion in hand, in as much as they do not ≈øeverally, or jointly make any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable account, either of the promi≈øes of Pardon, Eternal Life, and Salvation, to the performances of the≈øe Duties, or of the Exhortations to the practice of them, urged by ≈øuch Promi≈øes. The≈øe Rea≈øons are indeed ju≈øt Motives to the Duties of Piety and Charity, and urged as ≈øuch, in other Texts of Scripture. But of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ≈øort and nature from tho≈øe which are propounded in the Promi≈øes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations alledged by us. The≈øe Rea≈øons with others of like import (exclu≈øive of that which is urged by us) alledged as the only account of the nece≈ø≈øity of Good Works, do utterly de≈øtroy and make void the validity of the Motives, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Promi≈øes.</p>
               <p>And here (with as little di≈øparagement as may be to the Author) I think it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me to mention the great di≈ø≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, not to ≈øay Scandal, which I long ≈øince took from the common outlandi≈øh <hi>Catechi≈øm</hi> ≈øet forth fir≈øt by <hi>Zachary <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>r≈øin,</hi> and afterward by <hi>David Paraeus,</hi> Anno D. 1623. who intitles the third part of his Book, wherein he undertakes to give an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43236:70"/>account of the nece≈ø≈øity of Good Works, and all the practical part of Chri≈øtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>de Gratitudine, of Gratitude</hi> or Thankfulne≈øs to God for our Deliverance from the mi≈øery of the Natural State, and our Liberty recovered by Chri≈øt, which are the titles of his two former parts. This General Title and Account of Good Works, doth plainly ≈øuppo≈øe a negation of any antecedent nece≈ø≈øity of Conver≈øion and Repentance (which are the two fir≈øt things which he treats of under that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Thankfulne≈øs) unto the Effect of our Ju≈øtification and Salvation; unle≈øs it be rea≈øonable to ≈øay, that a man is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be thankfull for a Benefit before he hath it, or to the end that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Conver≈øion unto God, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by this mans Doctrine, mu≈øt be looked upon as a thing not in it ≈øelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to our Ju≈øtification or Remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, but as a Duty of Gratitude, for this Grace given unto us, either before, or without re≈øpect to our Conver≈øion. And we are to repent, and turn to God, not that our ≈øins may be forgiven, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are ≈øo; not that we may be ≈øaved, but becau≈øe we believe, and are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43236:70"/>confident that we ≈øhall be ≈øaved. So the whole practice of Chri≈øtian Piety, Holine≈øs and Righteou≈øne≈øs before God, mu≈øt proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an account of Thankfulne≈øs to him, for his free Grace that requires none of the≈øe things at our hands, as conditions of our Pardon or Reconciliation with his offended Maje≈øty.</p>
               <p>Not but that ≈øome other Ends and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and particularly tho≈øe which we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, are al≈øo named by the ≈øame Author, as part of the nece≈ø≈øity of Good Works. But all are reduced unto the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral account of Thankfulne≈øs, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive of any Moral cau≈øality, or condition of Ju≈øtification and Salvation. How well this Doctrine agrees with Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Scriptures of the Old Te≈øtament, or even with the de≈øign of the Go≈øpel; I mu≈øt leave to be judged by indifferent Readers. Becau≈øe I hold not my ≈øelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in this place to engage any further in the great Controver≈øie, about Ju≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith alone, or to take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of the Texts of St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly alledged, for the Solifidian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; which have been exactly con≈øidered by ≈øo many of our own Divines; and my own Sen≈øe of them el≈øewhere delivered in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43236:71"/>brief. Be≈øides that the covering of ≈øins attributed to Charity in the pre≈øent Text, though it extends to the Effect of Ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the mo≈øt Eminent Sen≈øe of the Phra≈øe; yet is not by our Interpretation, limited to that ≈øignification, but extended (as hath been ≈øaid) to the removal of puni≈øhments in this life, and to the abatement of them, both in this Life, and that which is to come, which are the Benefits that may be obtained by Charity, without any perfect Ju≈øtification of a ≈øinner.</p>
               <p>Now if any Per≈øon that reads this Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, having not been prepo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with any Prejudice again≈øt this Doctrine, or doubt of the Truth of it, ≈øhall think that the Work is over-done, by the Allegation of ≈øo many Texts and Arguments for the Confirmation of it, and ≈øo much pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in an≈øwering Objections again≈øt it, and ≈øhall therefore charge me with loading the Readers with a tedious Accumulation of ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Arguments, thereby abating the Per≈øpicuity of the Matter, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ≈øpeaks, upon occa≈øion of his long Di≈øcour≈øe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Per≈øpicuitas enim argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione elevatur, ‚ÄîRemque me√¢ ≈øententi√¢ minim√® dubiam, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentando dubiam facis.</hi> Tull. <hi>de Oratore Lib.</hi> 3.</note> to prove the Exi≈øtence of a Deity. I mu≈øt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43236:71"/>an≈øwer, that this Objection, can only be made by him that is ignorant of the contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, commonly a≈ø≈øerted and contended for, not only by Lutherans and Calvini≈øts abroad, but by ≈øeveral of our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Divines (till of late years) going that way. And 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the bad Con≈øequences of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine have been ≈øtrongly averted by the Authors thereof, in ≈øome of their Di≈øcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, yet the Event and Effect thereof hath, to my own Knowledge, in a multitude of Per≈øons, with whom I have had Occa≈øion to conver≈øe, notoriou≈øly abated the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of Charity, and the Zeal or Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Good Works, ≈øuppo≈øed by this Doctrine, to be neither ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor available to the Salvation of a Chri≈øtian. Many Per≈øons I have known, who upon this only Ground, have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ≈ølighted the practice of Charity, not only in their Life time, but al≈øo at their Death, comforting them≈øelves again≈øt all fear of Peril by this Neglect, from a mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notion, and Confidence of Ju≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith alone, without Good Works.</p>
               <p>The Sen≈øe of this dangerous Errour, was one thing that moved me to the Pains of this Plain Di≈øcour≈øe. Having vi≈øited di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43236:72"/>Per≈øons in their La≈øt ≈øickne≈øs, earne≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moving them (according to the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Church Liturgy in that Office) to Liberality towards the Poor, with little or no Succe≈øs, upon a Mi≈øper≈øwa≈øion of the no Nece≈ø≈øity, and as little Validity of ≈øuch Works to the ≈øafety of their future State.</p>
               <p>And though I have known Some, and do believe there are many of that Per≈øwa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that upon other Con≈øiderations, and better Principles, have been very Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Forward to Good Works; yet I have al≈øo had a particular Opportunity of ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; Knowing ≈øomething more than other Men, concerning the Neglect of this Duty, from the Place of my late Habitation for ≈øome Years, belonging to an Office of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtry, kept for the Probate, and Cu≈øtody of Wills and Te≈øtaments, made within the Juri≈ødiction of the Arch-deacon of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk:</hi> wherein I have ob≈øerved this la≈øt Record and Te≈øtimony of Charity, which ≈øhould have made up the Neglect and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that Duty before; to have been either wholly omitted, or very penuriou≈øly, and di≈øproportionably expre≈ø≈øed in many, and indeed mo≈øt Wills of Con≈øiderable E≈øtates.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:43236:72"/>
               <p>But to take off all appearance of Scandal to our Religion, upon this Account, it hath been, or may be made Evident, upon a ju≈øt Reckoning, that the Publick Good Works, and <hi>Donations</hi> of <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> to pious U≈øes in this Nation, ≈øince the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> have been more than Equal to any that ever were done by Papi≈øts, within the ≈øame Compa≈øs of Time, in any precedent Age: This per≈øonal Apology for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Di≈øcour≈øe, might perhaps have been ≈øpared; but was piou≈øly intended to the be≈øt Advantage, and greate≈øt Concern of all Per≈øons in the time of their Life, and at their Death. There being certainly no po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible U≈øe to be made of Worldly Goods ≈øo Acceptable to God, or ≈øo Advantagious to the Owners thereof, both in their Lives, and at their Death, as that which I am la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to promote from this Text.</p>
